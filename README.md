The original CatMe was the result of a 5 line code challenge where no rules
applied except that there must not be more than 5 lines of code (not including script tags). In exactly 5 lines, CatMe offered you the ability to see what your spirit cat and its associated name would be. If you didnâ€™t like it, you could simply get a new one with the click of a button. CatMe utilized The Cat API and its assortment of GIFs.

After living for three years in relative but aesthetically barren fame,
I decided to give CatMe a facelift in order to honor the true glory of
cats. Unfortunately I've now gone far over 5 lines of code (more than
5 files even), but the payoff is hopefully in the joy of watching a cat rendered as a GIF through a tv, through another screen.
